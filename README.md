# Gamelet

A starter program to write JavaScript games.

# Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an id of ball.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js"/>
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
